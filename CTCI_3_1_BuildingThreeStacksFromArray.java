    /*
    I think the most straight forward way to dividing 3 stacks from a single array is cutting the array
    into 3 pieces statically, commonly 3 equal parts.
    let's say 0 ~ n - 1 the array size
    0 ~ n/3 - 1; first
    n/3 ~ 2n/3 - 1; second
    2n/3 ~ n - 1; third

    Another more complicated way is dynamically allocate the stack
